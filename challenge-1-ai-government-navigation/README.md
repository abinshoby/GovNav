# Challenge 1 – Using AI to Help Australians Navigate Government Services

Welcome to the **SPYDER** team’s submission for **GovHack 2025**, **Challenge 1**: *Using AI to Help Australians Navigate Government Services*. This README offers a clear overview of our solution design, deliverables, and how to explore our implementation.

##  Challenge Overview

**Jurisdiction:** Australia  
**Prompt:**  
How might we use AI to make it easier for people to access, understand, and engage with the government services and supports they need—when they need them? This includes touchpoints around birth, job loss, becoming a carer, and more, which often require interactions with multiple government agencies across different levels. Key information is scattered, confusing, and overwhelming, especially during critical life moments. The solution should make services more accessible, intuitive, mobile-friendly, and seamless across agencies, with empathy and inclusion at its core. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

##  Deliverables

To meet and exceed the challenge’s expectations, our submission includes:

1. **Service Journey Mapping**  
   - Outline of user personas and critical life events (e.g., new parent, job seeker, carer), mapping their interactions with government services.

2. **Design & Architecture**  
   - Structural overview of the AI-powered system, including flow diagrams, user interface sketches (e.g., mobile-first experience), multi-agency integration, and conversational AI design.

3. **Prototype Demonstrations**  
   - Interactive simulations showcasing real use cases (e.g., navigating postpartum support, carer services, or disaster relief assistance).

4. **Data Integration & Datasets**  
   - Incorporating at least one example dataset, showing how open data sources are ingested and surfaced to users for timely, relevant guidance. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

5. **Slide Deck Summary**  
   - A concise visual presentation that communicates the solution’s concept, design, and expected impact.
