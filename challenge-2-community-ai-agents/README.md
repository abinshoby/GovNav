# Challenge 2 – Community AI Agents: Bridging Service Access Gaps

Welcome to the **SPYDER** team’s submission for **GovHack 2025**, Challenge 2: *Community AI Agents – Bridging Service Access Gaps*. This README provides an overview of our approach, deliverables, and how to explore our solution.

##  Challenge Overview

**Jurisdiction:** Australia  
**Prompt:**  
How can we design _Agentic AI_ solutions that autonomously assist residents in discovering, accessing, and engaging with local government and community services? :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

Many residents—especially those with low digital literacy, language barriers, or limited access—struggle to navigate government systems. Agents should be autonomous, adaptable, and inclusive. For example, they might:

- Locate the nearest food bank, book a slot, send reminders, and connect to volunteer supports :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

##  Deliverables

We’ve structured our submission to meet the challenge’s expectations:

1. **Proposal**  
   - Vision and narrative describing how our Agentic AI enhances accessibility and inclusion.

2. **Solution Model**  
   - Architecture, data flow, UI/UX design, algorithmic considerations, and attention to ethics, trust, and privacy.

3. **Examples/Simulations**  
   - Use-case stories or simulation flows illustrating multi-step tasks (e.g. appointment booking, reminders, form completion).

4. **Presentation**  
   - A concise slide deck summarizing the solution’s objectives, workings, and impact.

5. **Government Dataset Integration**  
   - At least one dataset included and referenced, as required by the challenge criteria :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
