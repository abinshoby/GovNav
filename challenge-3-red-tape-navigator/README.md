# Challenge 3 – The Red Tape Navigator

Welcome to the **SPYDER** team’s submission for **GovHack 2025**, **Challenge 3: *The Red Tape Navigator***. This README outlines our solution’s concept, deliverables, structure, and how you can explore it in depth.

##  Challenge Overview

**Jurisdiction:** Australia  
**Prompt (paraphrased):**  
Australia's regulatory landscape spans local, state, and federal levels, making it tricky for businesses and individuals to know which laws apply—and where they conflict or overlap. The challenge invites innovative digital solutions—from web apps and chatbots to visual tools and data frameworks—that help users discover, visualize, and navigate regulatory obligations. Using at least one Commonwealth dataset is required, with additional points for integrating AI according to standards like the AI Technical Standards design statements.:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

##  Deliverables

To address the problem effectively, our submission features:

1. **Regulatory Discovery Tool**  
   - Empowers users to search by location, activity, or industry to uncover applicable regulatory requirements at all government levels.

2. **Interactive Visual Map or Navigator**  
   - Presents overlapping and hierarchical regulations visually (e.g., flowchart, map), making it simpler to comprehend jurisdictional layers.

3. **AI-Powered Assistant (Optional Bonus)**  
   - A conversational interface (e.g. chatbot) that can field queries like “What license do I need as a café in Adelaide?” while adhering to AI Technical Standards.:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

4. **Dataset Integration**  
   - Includes and references at least one Commonwealth source—like the Federal Register of Legislation, Commonwealth Statute Book, or Australian Government Organisations Register. Optional state datasets may also be integrated.:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

5. **Presentation Slides**  
   - A slide deck showcasing our solution's user flow, key design principles, and expected impact.
